Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

  	Louise’s play started a fundraising goal in a short time span of time. Now she wants to analyze different campaigns in relation to their launch dates and the funding goals. 
  
 ## Purpose -
 
 	The purpose of the project was to use pivot tables and graphing skill in Excel to visualize campaign outcomes successful, failed, and canceled based on launch date. In this assignment I used technical analysis deliverables and a written report to deliver your results

## Analysis and Challenges

  	Challenges and difficulties faced were pivot tables used to show data in a way that shows outcomes. Another challenge I came across was figuring out formulas, calculating and coding parts of excel which is something I am semi new too.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Analyzing the outcomes based on launch date using the line chart was interesting. In the start of the graph the “successful” line was exponentially larger than the “canceled” line but as time progressed the outcome ended up the same but something strange happened in the middle of the month of may the declining of successful outcomes based on launch date fell dramatically. The canceled line never rose above 1. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Analyzing the outcomes based on goals  using the line chart was intriguing. The lines in the chart inversely mirror each other's movements exactly. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	Challenges and difficulties encountered were filtering and sorting the goal money reached into the money levels as well as changing the data type.

## Results
Overall the results of the project were really unique and interesting, the outcome based on launch percentage both ended up being 39% as time went on. Comes on goal made a last minute turn showing failure as time progressed.      

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

In the last quarter of the year campaigns with later launch dates have started to decrease. The first 3 quarters of the year is the most popular and efficient best to start a campaign around april and may is the best times to start. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

As time progressed on throughout the year campaigns were still successful and hit their goal but the goal limit was less than the first 3 quarters of the year campaign goals.  

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Some limitations were columns.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We can show graphs showing different relationships. For example a relationship between the goal and pledged amount
