# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The goal of this analysis is to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total fares on a weekly  basis for each area. PyBer operates in three types of areas: urban, suburban, and rural. We compared each area  metrics and the average ride fare to the total number of rides per city. In  this challenge, we organized  and created a summary data frame that organized total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver.

## Results
Using this in the summary, we can see that there is a pattern occurring  between how populated the area is and the total number of rides, which directly affects the total number of drivers, total fare, and both averages. The average amount in fare each  ride and each driver seem to increase.. Less ride drivers in rural areas may lead to a higher average fare each ride and driver.

In the multiple-line chart, we are able to compare total fares by area type over a time span  of five months. The number of rides seem to peak at the end of February and fluctuates during the month of March. All the area types tend to follow the same pattern throughout time, except for the pattern  in suburban areas, where we see a significant increase in April.

## Summary
Since the fare amount by area type seems to increase during the month of April in the suburb area, the Pyber should study what causes this increase, especially because the fare amount decreases for other types of areas.

At Last the average amount each ride shows a substantial increase from more populated areas to less populated areas . However, the average amount each drive increases drastically when following the same pattern . This indicates that the number of drivers may be exponentially lower than expected. The company may want to allocate more drivers to rural areas to capitalize on its profits.
